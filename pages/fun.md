## Hobbies

### Board Games
I am a big fan of modern designer board games. 
Here is a very short list of some of my favourite games:
- Blood on the Clocktower
- Brass: Birmingham
- Wavelength
- Cascadia
- Cockroach Poker
- Inhuman Conditions
- Captain Sonar
- Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy
- Flamme Rouge
- Chinatown

### Running
I grew-up doing athletics most of my life. But as an adult I have started to enjoy running for my own pleasure again.
I mostly run as a meditative exercise as I find it really easy to let my mind wander when running.
I'll often solve my coding or research problems during a jog. 

I have managed to run a half-marathon a couple times with only moderate levels of pain.

### Reading
I enjoy reading books. About 50% of the books I read are fantasy, but I generally read in a wide range of genres, fiction and non-fiction. 

## Travel
As of 2022, I have visited every state in Australia plus the two main territories (Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory).

I have visited 9 countries:
- Australia
- New Zealand
- United States
- Mexico
- Fiji
- Vanuatu
- New Caledonia
- Colombia
- Germany
