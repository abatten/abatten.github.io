My research broadly revolves around trying to understand the Universe. My work usually involves using large computer simulations or other forms of '*Big Data*'.
I am *usually* a theorist and love working with large, cosmological simulations. However I do occassionally dabble with observations and even human-based experiments.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Data Analyst at Swinburne University of Technology working with Prof. Chris Fluke. 

My PhD research revolved around studing the intergalactic medium and how its evolution can inform us about the history of galaxies. 
I used large, cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to determine how fast radio bursts can probe the the effects of active galactic nuclei and the ionised gas in the intergalactic medium.

## Research Interests

### The Intergalactic Medium

The majority of the matter in the Universe does not reside inside of galaxies. Instead, most of the mass of the Universe resides in the low-density, highly ionised region outside of galaxies known as the *Intergalactic Medium* (IGM). 
Appoximately 80% of baryons in the present-day Universe are known to be located in the IGM. 
The fact that the IGM contains the vast majory of the mass of the Universe means it is a crutial component to study if we wish to have a complete understanding of the evolution of matter. 

The IGM is tightly linked to the evolution of stars and galaxies. 
The IGM provided the initial conditions from which galaxies grew and is reservoir of prestine gas which galaxies accrete to form new stars.
This means that it is impossible to disentangle the evolution of galaxies from the evolution of the IGM. To understand one, we must understand the other.
However, the IGM isn't so easy to observe.
The high-temperatures and low-densties makes observations in the optical and UV extremly unfavourable. 

### Fast Radio Bursts

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a class of bright, millisecond, extragalactic radio transients.
In the short time since their discovery in 2007, they already apear to be a useful tool for studying the Universe.
The key propery of FRBs is their dispersion measure (DM) which is extremely sensite to the total number of electrons along their line-of-sight.
Due to the extragalactic nature of FRBs, their dispersion measure makes them an excellent probe of the highly ionised plasma that fills the intergalactic medium.
