I am currently working in a dual role as a Postdoctoral researcher in the [Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/) at the Swinburne University of Technology.

In my working week, about 60% of the time, you can find me working in the Space Domain Awareness Laboratory tracking satellites around Earth and determining what to do if we *lose* one.
The rest of the time, I am trying to resolve the Hubble tension by measuring the Hubble constant with Tip of the Red Giant Branch Stars (TRGB Stars).

My other primary interests include using simulations to study the composition and evolution of the intergalactic medium through cosmic time, the common envelope phase of giant stars, and fast radio bursts. 
I am an associate researcher with ARC Centre of Excellence for All-Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions ([ASTRO 3D](https://astro3d.org.au/)).

### Current Position
#### Postdoctoral Researcher in Space Domain Awareness (Since May 2023)
In May 2023, I join the Space Domain Awareness Laboratory at Swinburne University of Technology with Prof. Chris Fluke.

#### Postdoctoral Researcher in Extragalactic Astrophysics (Since October 2022)
Since October 2022, I have been employed part-time (0.4 FTE) at Swinburne with Prof. Jeremy Mould, measuring the Hubble constant (H0) using the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Stars.


### Previous Positions

#### Postdoctoral Researcher and Data Analyst (2023)
In January 2023, I rejoined as a part-time (0.6 FTE) Postdoctoral researcher and data analyst in the Human-Machine Laboratory with Prof. Chris Fluke.
In this project we were reaching how effectively humans and AI work together in teams, particularly in decision-making environments.
In this position I ran experimental trials that involved collectioning biometric data from participants. 
I led the analysis of participant task performance and eye tracking data from pupil labs devices. 

#### ADACS Internship (2022)
From July to the beginning of October 2022, I was a research software engineer intern at Astronomy Data and Computing Services (ADACS) in Melbourne.

#### Postdoctoral Researcher (2022)
From April to June 2022, I was a Postdoctoral researcher and data analyst in the Human-Machine Laboratory at Swinburne with Prof. Chris Fluke. 
I ran experimental trials and conditions which involved connecting people to various biometric sensors, including eye-tracking glasses, ECG, and GSR monitors.
I led the analysis of the ECG-heart rate data and the participant work load perception (NASA TLX) scores. 

### Education Information

#### Doctor of Philosophy (2018-2022)
I completed my Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in astrophysics at Swinburne University of Technology in the [Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/) in 2022.
In my PhD, I used large cosmological simulations and fast radio bursts to probe the intergalactic medium and the evolution of galaxies. My supervisors were Prof. Alan Duffy and Prof. Emma Ryan-Weber.

Thesis title: *Fast radio bursts as probes of the intergalactic medium and galaxy evolution*

#### Masters of Research (2017-2018)
I completed my Master of Research (MRes) at Macquarie University in November 2017.
For my Master's thesis, I studied and ran simulations of the common envelope phase of giant stars.
In particular, I was interested in how the dynamics of the common envelope change in a system that contains *three* bodies as opposed to the traditional two. My MRes supervisor was Prof. Orsola de Marco.

This Title: *Too Close; Yet Too Far: The Common Envelope Interaction of Triple Systems*

#### Bachelor of Advanced Science (2013-2015)
I completed my undergraduate degree (BAdvSci) at Macquarie University in Sydney, AUS, in 2015.
In 2014 I won the Dick Makinson Prize and in 2015 the J. C. Ward FRS Physics Prize, both given to the top performing Physics student in the 2nd and 3rd-year undergraduate cohort.
For my capstone project in 2015, I won the Judyth Sacks Professional and Community Engagement Prize for <a href="https://www.adambatten.com/outreach/revamping_the_aao_and_aat/">revamping the Anglo-Australian Telescope Visitor Centre and Observatory Website</a>.
As a summer vacation scholar at Macquarie, I worked with Prof. Richard McDermid on MUSE data reduction and Prof. Orsola de Marco on the binary fraction of planetary nebulae.
