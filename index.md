I am a PhD candidate in the [Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/) at Swinburne University of Technology.

I specialise in using large simulations to study the composition and evolution of the Intergalactic Medium through cosmic time. 
My research is part of the ARC Centre of Excellence for All-Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions ([ASTRO 3D](https://astro3d.org.au/)).
