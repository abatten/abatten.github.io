In 2020 the Pint of Science festival went online brought science into the homes of thounds of people across australia.
As part of the festival it included four moderated panels. 
I was an invited speaker on the "What's the Matter?" live panel that focused on astronomy, quantum mechanics and nuclear fusion.

The panel was live streamed on Facebook and Youtube and we would each have about five minutes to explain our research area.
Throughout the live stream the public could send in their questions for us to answer live.

My co-panelists were Kyla Adams, A/Prof. Joe Khachan and we were hosted by Kirsten Banks. You can watch the recording of the live stream on YouTube with the following link or in the video player below. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMX2F1nXwr0?start=270">https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMX2F1nXwr0?start=270</a>
