This was the final product of two months of comedy training and workshops with the Sydney Comedy School.

This event had 23 scientists from all across Melbourne and Geelong infusing humour and laughs into their science talks.

We performed in three different shows over two nights, with each show having 7 or 8 scientists. The topics ranged from seasonal allergies to dinosaurs to climate science, insect conservation, cyber security, exoplanets, and more.

In the show, I talked about my research and how it's helping to prevent the 'Space Apocalypse'.

This show was hosted by David Crisante and you can watch the recording of the live stream on YouTube with the following link or in the video player below. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ww8XMqiM9RA?si=696SWo7ws3TTdU_e">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww8XMqiM9RA</a>
